## Lyrics

```
"We got a transport coming"
"Aye, on it, get ready" / eye on him, get ready

these are blacked out SUVs 
inna top deck brutes
stealthy men in masks all down
tracers rolling through the urbs

black death dressed in suits
i got eyes, they got goods
i got fire, they are null
we got red, they are bulls

coped out, shades up on them suits
roll out, gotta getem while we move 
dropped the spike
call the tech they hide behind 

the truth defiant
there are rules of war 
they do not ignore
stealthy entity, (in) a moment I adore

in all down masks bring em
before dawn, fix em good enough
till the wave of death turns around

abandon all (normal) the rules ???
edge of shadows rolling through the kingdom of hate ???
make them pay with gallows ???

----

these are blacked out SUVs in a top tech brutes / top deck brutes
stealthy men in masks all down
tracers rolling through urbs

black death dressed in suits / filling suits
i got eyes, they got goods
i got fire, they are null
we got red, they are bulls

coped out, shades up on them suits
roll out, gotta getem while we move, 
dropped the spike
call the tech they hide behind 

the truth defiant
there are rules of war 
they do not ignore
stealthy entity I adore

in all down masks
before dawn, fix em good enough
till the wave of death turns around
abandon all (normal) the rules
edge of shadows, 
rolling through the kingdom of hate
make them pay with gallows

```
